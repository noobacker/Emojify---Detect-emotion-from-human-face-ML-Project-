**Emojify - Detect Emotion from Human Face**

This project is a facial emotion recognition system that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on the FER2013 dataset to detect emotions from human faces. The system preprocesses facial images, trains a CNN model, and incorporates OpenCV for face detection. It predicts emotions and displays them alongside the original image, demonstrating the practical application of deep learning in emotion recognition for various real-world scenarios such as human-computer interaction, sentiment analysis, and healthcare.
